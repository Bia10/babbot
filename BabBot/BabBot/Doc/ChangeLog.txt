  a low level paladin which is our starting testbed.
- Added the UI to select a mob and add it to our enemy list
- Added a script to support zf style bindings
- Better state management (scripting)
- Added Caronte, a derivative pathing library forked from the modified
  version of PPather by benthor
- StateManager now stores the LastState correctly when starting and 
  stopping the bot
- Changed the way movement works when chasing a mob.  But it's still not 
  taking into account the time spent calculating a new path and the fact 
  that the mob might have moved in the meanwhile
- Added Looting (yeah! BabBot can now loot the mobs it kills)
