- Idle. What do we do? Check for enemies, (gathering nodes), grinding spots, (quest areas)
- Priority to grinding spots? Let's move to our next grinding spot
- Priority to enemies? Let's kill them right away

== Grinding routine ==

Requirements:
- Must have a list of mobs to hunt down

- Must have a set of waypoints to grind through
OR
- (Must have a database of mobs and corresponding areas to grind through)

Actions:
- Get the list of waypoints and read the next one available that we want to cycle through
- Build a path to our currently selected waypoint and store it
- Cycle through the new path we just calculated by calling MoveToState at each FSM tick (waypoints should be pretty close, 3-5 yards between each)
- Check for interesting mobs
- If an interesting mob is found go to the kill routine
