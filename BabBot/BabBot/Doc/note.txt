Various notes and snippets of code that will be handy later on..


you can use "/script RepopMe()" to click the release button, then do "/script RetrieveCorpse()" 
when you're within 30 yards. these are functions built into the game so you dont have to 
worry about calculating where the buttons to click are based on the current resolution.


Player dead if health value == 0
After that player is ghost if health value == 1



When your health == 0, save your current x,y,z to variables, then waypoint to those points 
until distance to that point <= 30 yards and no enemy is within 20 yards (randomly walk around until #2 is true).

[[objectaddress+0x8]+0x17*4]
Explanation: read object base + 8 for a pointer to UNIT_FIELDS. 
If you check the post unit fields health is 0x17, you read from unit fields + 0x17 multiplied by 4 because 
each array slot* is 4 bytes.

To attack with the melee attack by script:
Slightly longer, but more complete method to just find attack anywhere on your bar.

/script if not ma then for i = 1,72 do if IsAttackAction(i) then ma = i; end; end; end; if ma then if not IsCurrentAction(ma) then UseAction(ma); end; else AttackTarget("target");end;

To loot, let's have the end user set the "Interact with Target" hotkey in WoW and use that one. We first have to 
select the corpse of course. That can be used for vendoring and repairing. Having auto-loot on will get rid of having to
click with the mouse on the stuff we are looting
