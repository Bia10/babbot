BabBot - WoW Automa
===================

Welcome to BabBot. This is a World of Warcraft bot. 

** At the current stage of development this should be considered an early ALPHA release.**


Configuration
=============
Some parameters are still hardcoded and will be editable during a later release. Right now you're 
required to run on a 32bit OS (XP or Vista). Development releases for x64 processors are
under testing. You can still compile it in 64bit mode from the sources though.

In order to run, BabBot requires to be run from a user with administrator privileges
so that it can run the WoW client as a guest user (currently the username is "guest" and
it's got to be enabled in your OS).
